# ToDo-Flask
This is mainly focused on backend working. I have not put much work into frontend development, yet...

A simple To-Do list web application built using Flask framework. Currently it is able to perform following operationa:
1. Display all unfinished and fisished tasks
2. Add new tasks
3. Edit unfinished tasks
4. Mark tasks as done

It requires following Python modules:
1. Flask
2. flask-SQLAlchemy
3. datetime

Running the app:
1. Install required libraries
2. Run the app.py file
3. Open the link that you will get in any browser in your computer to access the web application
